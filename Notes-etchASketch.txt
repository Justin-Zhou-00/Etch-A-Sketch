css variables
Purpose: Variables are used to better understand css values that would be reused throughtout a document.

Syntax:
--main-color: black;
color: var(--main-color);

or --main-color: #00ff00 // can be set to any hex value.
This makes it more readable.

It is common to define the variables in the :root pseudo-class so that it
can be applied globally across the HTML document.

** :root{
	--main-bg-color: brown;
   }


repeat("# of times repeated", "size of the grid")
repeat() is used to repeat the number of columns or rows in grid, 
this is used for readability and simplicity. 
Instead of:
	grid-template-columns: 1f 1f 1f 1f;
	grid-template-columns:repeat(4, 1f);


css grid

flexbox used for one dimension
css grid used for two dimensions

Grid uses a container

create a container in html with a class name which can later be used to link up in css

css
.container{
	display:grid;
	grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr//used to define the width of each column
	commonly uses fr// which stands for fraction units, 
	the grid is then seperated in terms of fractions

	grid-template-row: //used to define the height of each row
}
